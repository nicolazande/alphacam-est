## Overview

AlphaCAM add-in that optimizes the extraction of significant features from imported solids (such as those from AutoCAD, Inventor, etc.). This add-in will efficiently assign the most suitable operation and tool to each feature based on customer preferences, which can be conveniently defined through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The operations will be organized in an optimal sequence, prioritizing fewer tool changes and minimizing overall processing time.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts key features from imported solid models.
- **Operation Assignment**: Assigns the most appropriate machining operations and tools to each extracted feature.
- **User Preferences**: Allows users to define preferences and settings through a user-friendly GUI.
- **Optimization**: Organizes operations in an optimal sequence to reduce tool changes and minimize processing time.

## Installation

To install the add-in, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](#).
2. Extract the downloaded file to your desired directory.
3. Open AlphaCAM and navigate to the add-ins section.
4. Click on "Add" and select the extracted add-in file.
5. Ensure the add-in is enabled.

## Usage

1. **Import Solid Models**: Import solid models from supported formats (AutoCAD, Inventor, etc.).
2. **Define Preferences**: Open the add-in GUI and define your machining preferences and settings.
3. **Run Feature Extraction**: Execute the feature extraction process.
4. **Review Assigned Operations**: Review the automatically assigned operations and tools.
5. **Optimize Sequence**: Ensure the operations are organized in the optimal sequence to minimize tool changes and processing time.
6. **Export/Generate Toolpaths**: Generate the toolpaths for the optimized operations and export them as needed.

## User Interface

The add-in features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to easily set your preferences and review the assigned operations. Key components of the GUI include:

- **Preferences Panel**: Define your tool and operation preferences.
- **Feature List**: View the extracted features and their assigned operations.
- **Optimization Settings**: Configure settings for optimizing operation sequences.
